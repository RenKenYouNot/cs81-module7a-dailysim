What was your approach to designing the schedule?
I chose personal activities that reflect my daily life and how I spend my time.

What was one challenge or unexpected behavior you encountered?
A huge issue was the <meta charset> tag that prevented the page from rendering correctly. 
Also, the long durations (hours) made the simulation appear stuck until I realized they needed to be shortened for testing.

What does this assignment teach you about async code?
This assignment taught me that asynchronous code, using setTimeout, allows parts of the script to run later without blocking 
the entire program. 

What creative element did you add?
I added a surprise element where, after playing with my cats, a random mood ("content," "tired," or "ready for a nap") is 
displayed after a short, random delay.

How does this project simulate or differ from real-world schedules?
It simulates real-world schedules by showing activities in a sequence with set durations. However, it differs by being
predictable and lacking the spontaneity of actual life.
